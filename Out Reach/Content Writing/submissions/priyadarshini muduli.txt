3) RAJA
"Rajo is a four day celebration of motherhood and womanhood, the days of just appreciating the great personality in our life, the days of just valuing their importance,
the days of getting ready and wearing new clothes, the days of having delicious PODA PEETHA." 

The blue sky during Summers turns out to be dark and white with patches of rain-bearing cloud moving here and there. It is the occasion of soothing weather,
relief from the heat and the new hope for next agricultural season. 
The celebration of womanhood and togetherness. The word Raja itself in Odia means menstruation and itâ€™s a conjecture that mother Earth goes for three days long menstrual
cycle during this period. This is the ritual to remove the taboo and myths about menstruation and acknowledge this beautiful process of nature. Speaking of which, this festival
acknowledges the women as a beautiful creation by nature and freeing them from the soiety burden. Its not only about the women but also about acknowledging and protecting the 
nature's health as the mother earth bleeds for three days. Odisha stands out to celebrate the menstrual cycle, standing out breaking all the tabbos and myths, sending a 
message that women are not impure during their periods.

The time has come to understand the culture and the history behind the festival and celebrate it together and keep its value. Tean Enigma wishes you a very happy and prosperous
Raja.
 
Team Enigma.
