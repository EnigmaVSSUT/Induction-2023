1. First of all, **`pull the upstream repository`** (like you did in Open Source Task-2) to update your local repository

2.	Create a **webpage** having **`About Me`**, **`My Interests`**, **`Gallery`**, **`Contact Me`**. You can add other sections, images or multiple pages, that's up to your creativity. To get you started, a screenshot of a sample webpage is provided. 
<img src="./Sample%20Webpage.png" width="50%">

3.	Change the text and images according to your preferences.

4.	You can select color codes and font styles of your own choice but make sure that the format of the webpage is same as the sample given to you.

5. Main points to keep in mind:<br>
    i) Your page should be [**`Responsive`**](https://web.dev/learn/design/)<br>
    ii) **`Do not copy the sample`**. The fields should be same but play with your creativity

6.	Next, you have to **host your website** on your GitHub Account. [Click here to learn how to host a website in GitHub.](https://youtu.be/OltY8JIaP-4)

7.	After completion of the above steps, make a folder of **`<Your Name>`** inside the [Task Submission](./Task%20Submission) folder.

8.	**Inside your designated folder add your `HTML` file, `CSS` file , a `link` text file containing the URL of your webpage hosted on GitHub and a **`screenshot`** of your task**. Make sure that you have added the images used in the website in the <Your name> folder.
The folder `Induction-2023/Web Development/Task-1/Task Submission/Ananya Mohapatra/` is uploaded for reference.

9.	Finally commit your changes and `create a pull request` along with the **URL of your webpage hosted in the description section of the Pull request**.

All the best!!<br>
