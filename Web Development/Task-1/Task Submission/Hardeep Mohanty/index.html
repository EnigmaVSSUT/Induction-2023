          Hello, my name is Hardeep Mohanty, and I am a student currently studying Computer Science and Engineering.
           I am excited to be a part of enigma induction to learn new programming and development skills which will help me in future ventures and development.
           As a student, I am passionate about learning to code and to make websites and apps.
            I believe that these skills will help me also in my enetrpreneauship journey, and I am excited to explore these ideas further in my studies.
             I have done my schooling and intermediate from St.Xavier's High School Kedargouri Bhubaneswar and currently I'm pursuing my Bachelors in Technology 
             degree from Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology.

         since my childhood days. I have also represented my school in various competetions and won many tournaments. I also like photography a lot
         and in I also used to have an instagram page dedicated to it. Street photography is my favourite domain. After coming to college I have also developed 
         interest in coding and knowing more and more about new upcoming Technology. I have fascination for bikes too and bike rides are always a therapy for me.
