    <h3><p>SO MY AIM IS TO DO SOCIAL SERVICE BY OPENING MANY ORPHANAGES AND OLD AGE HOME</p></h3>
        <p>My aim in life is to open an orphanage and an old age home. My grandmother has been my biggest inspiration and support so far in life.I feel it would be the best way to honor her. She has always taught me the importance of helping others and I think this would be the best way to put that teaching into practice.The necessity for the NGO for senior citizens in India has increased lately due to the increased ill-treatment and suffering older people have to endure after they become incapable and helpless. After becoming old, the mental and physical health of an individual deteriorates.There are many orphans out there needing tender love and care. These kids need to be brought to orphanages that can provide the care and the attention they had been missing. The orphanages provide food, clothes, education and a safe environment for them to grow up into responsible adults.</p>
