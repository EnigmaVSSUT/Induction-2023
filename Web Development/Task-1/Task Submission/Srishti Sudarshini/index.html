                Here buzzes the fashion bee,,,
                Hailing from the western scape of the left coast of India; The Sambalpur. 
                Grew through the upbringing of my mother JNV, at Deogarh from 6th to 12th. 
                Having been a epicure since inheriting those genes, 
                clearly from my mother, i bloom with chocolates, blenders n ovens.
                Breeding the finest interest in this witty soul, I chose a life with codes n programmes.

            Feeding my crave for designing, I foresee a wondrously fashionable world through my pen. 
            Running through numerous websites, megazines n professional accounts,
            i like to learn new ideas and frame raw styles unique in their own way. 
            Having a boring day, goin' craaazy, I make it easier by jus' going through the clock with desserts, chocolates n brewing my fav time over.
