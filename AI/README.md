# AI/ML

AI/ML—short for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)—represents an important evolution in computer science and data processing that is quickly transforming a vast array of industries.Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.

# Task: Create webapp using Streamlit
## Overview
Streamlit is a framework used to build webapps with python. You have to create a webapp that has a navigation menu containing two sub-items: image and video. Each of the sections should have options to either select a local file or use the camera to capture the image/video. The selected file should then be displayed with a caption (for this, a textbox should be provided for taking input).

## Additional Tips
* Download python from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install the required type. During installation, do check the `ADD TO PATH` checkbox in the installer. Alternatively, you can grab python from Microsoft Store(for windows). Version 3.10 is recommended.
* Preferably, the project should be made in a virtual environment. To create a virtual environment, run `python -m venv <name-of-the-directory>`. To activate the virtual environment, run `<name-of-your-virtual-env>/scripts/activate`. Reference: [Here](https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv)
* To install streamlit, run `pip install streamlit`.

## Requirements
* The project must be hosted (in streamlit) and marked as `public`
* Menus for 'image' and 'video' should be implemented.
* Repo must contain a `requirements.txt` file. To create, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` and filter out any non-required dependencies.


## Evaluation
The notebook evaluation will be based on:
* How well the code is documented
* How optimised the requirements.txt file is
* The overall execution of the code
